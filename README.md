## About the Project
Welcome to our project, How Sweet Is This!â€”a exploration of our favorite candy. This web page combines engaging content and images to celebrate and share the sweet joy of candy.

## Project Overview
In this assignment, we are tasked with creating a visually appealing and informative web page centered around our favorite candy, and we chose Hershey's Cookies 'n' Cream. Key features include:

 - Semantic HTML: The page is built using appropriate HTML5 elements for clear structure and readability.
 - Liquid Layout: Designed with a responsive approach, the content is centered and adjusts gracefully to adjust to tablets.
 - Custom Styling: The page is styled with CSS, incorporating a custom font and various visual enhancements like gradient backgrounds and hover effects.
 - Interactive Footer: A footer includes a logo, and a simple contact form (non-functional).
